openvas-manager 2.0.0 (2011-02-08)

This is the first release of the openvas-manager 2.0 module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System release 4 (OpenVAS-4). The OpenVAS Manager is
the central management service between the actual security scanner and various
user clients.

OpenVAS Manager 2.0 represents a significantly advanced feature set. Most
notable is the new plugin-based report format framework which allows to produce
arbitrary scan reports (text, graphs, maps, connectors etc.). The new
master-slave mode allow to network multiple Manager instances. The whole
functionality is available via the extended protocol: OMP 2.0.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Matthew Mundell, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Michael Wiegand and Felix Wolfsteller.

Main changes since 1.0.x:

* Report Format plugin framework. All previous reporting features were converted
  to plugins. The XML representation of a report is now the base for any plugin
  and thus consistency of reports is improved.

  Report Format Plugins can be set active so that they appear in the selection
  lists. Selections can consider content types so that for example only the
  plugins with content type "text" are offered as email body.

  It is possible to use parameters for the plugins so the user can adjust the
  behaviour of the Report Format to the individual preferences or needs.

  A verification method allows to distribute signatures for valid plugins via
  the NVT Feed.

* New default Report Format: TXT for simple text.

* New default Report Format: LaTeX for LaTeX source.

* New sample Report Format: Simple Bar Chart.
  Demonstrates how to use Gnuplot for graphical reports.

* New sample Report Format: Simple Topo Plot.
  Demonstrates how to use Graphviz for graphical reports.

* New sample Report Format: Simple Pie Chart.
  Demonstrates how to use PyChart for graphical reports.

* New sample Report Format: Simple Map Plot.
  Demonstrates how to use MapServer and GDAL for graphical reports.

* New sample Report Format: Sourcefire Host Input.
  Demonstrates that Report Formats can be used to build connectors.

* Master-Slave feature. Any OpenVAS Manager can use one or many other OpenVAS
  Manager as slave to run scans. The whole scan task is transferred to the
  slave, results are continuously reported to the Master during scan process.
  After the scan is finished all data are removed from the slave.

  The master can also retrieve system reports from the slave and thus can
  collect the performance overview for all configured slaves.

* New Escalator: HTTP GET. This allows for example to access text message (SMS)
  gateways or ticket management systems.

* Extended Escalator: For email escalation it is now possible
  to select from configured Report Formats to be included in the email body.

* Agents: A verification method was added. This allows to distribute signatures
  for valid agents via the NVT Feed.

* Credentials: Can now be edited. This allows to change the login name or
  password without the need to create a new scan configuration.

* Credentials: Auto-generated installer packages are now created on the fly. If
  the generators are improved, it is now easy to create an updated package for

the actual security scanner and various user clients.
Release 2.0 is part of OpenVAS 4, the next generation
of the Open Vulnerability Assessment System.

OpenVAS Manager 2.0 represents a significantly advanced feature set.
Most notable is the new plugin-based report format framework which
allows to produce arbitrary scan reports (text, graphs, maps, connectors etc).
The new master-slave mode allow to network multiple Manager instances.
The whole functionality is available via the extended protocol: OMP 2.0.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Matthew Mundell, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Michael Wiegand and Felix Wolfsteller.

Central new features of OpenVAS Manager 2.0:

* Report Format plugin framework. All previous reporting features
  were converted to plugins. The XML representation of a report
  is now the base for any plugin and thus consistency of reports
  is improved.

  Report Format Plugins can be set active so that they
  appear in the selection lists. Selections can consider
  content types so that for example only the plugins with
  content type "text" are offered as Email body.

  It is possible to use parameters for the plugins so the
  user can adjust the behaviour of the Report Format to
  the individual preferences or needs.

  A verification method allows to distribute signatures
  for valid plugins via the NVT Feed.

* New default Report Format: TXT for simple text.

* New default Report Format: LaTeX for LaTeX source.

* New sample Report Format: Simple Bar Chart.
  Demonstrates how to use Gnuplot for graphical reports.

* New sample Report Format: Simple Topo Plot.
  Demonstrates how to use Graphviz for graphical reports.

* New sample Report Format: Simple Pie Chart.
  Demonstrates how to use PyChart for graphical reports.

* New sample Report Format: Simple Map Plot.
  Demonstrates how to use MapServer and GDAL for graphical reports.

* New sample Report Format: Sourcefire Host Input.
  Demonstrates that Report Formats can be used to build connectors.

* Master-Slave feature. Any OpenVAS Manager can use one or many other
  OpenVAS Manager as slave to run scans. The whole scan task
  is transferred to the slave, results are continuously reported
  to the Master during scan process. After the scan is finished
  all data are removed from the slave.

  The master can also retrieve system reports from the slave and
  thus can collect the performance overview for all configured slaves.

* New Escalator: HTTP GET. This allows for example to access
  text message (SMS) gateways or ticket management systems.

* Extended Escalator: For EMail escalation it is now possible
  to select from configured Report Formats to be included in the
  Email body.

* Agents: A verification method was added. This allows to
  distribute signatures for valid agents via the NVT Feed.

* Credentials: Can now be edited. This allows to change the login
  name or password without the need to create a new scan configuration.

* Credentials: Auto-generated installer packages are now created on
  the fly. If the generators are improved, it is now easy to create
  an updated package for already existing credentials.

* OMP self-documentation: Part of the Managers' XML-based communication protocol
  OMP 2.0 is to deliver the full specification and documentation of the
  protocol itself (command "HELP"). It can be retrieved as XML-,
  RNC- or HTML representation.

* Targets: Various opportunities have been added to specify and combine IP ranges.

* Tasks: The task overview is delivered much faster now.

* Reports: The report filtering is much faster now.


openvas-manager 1.0.0 (2010-07-29)

This is the 1.0.0 release of the openvas-manager module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS).

OpenVAS Manager 1.0 represents almost 2 years of intensive work.  The mission of
OpenVAS Manager is to offer powerful and comfortable vulnerability management on
top of the actual vulnerability scanner, OpenVAS Scanner 3.1.

The OpenVAS Manager is a layer between the OpenVAS Scanner and various client
applications. The upcoming clients cover web, desktop and command line
technology and will replace the classic OpenVAS Client.

Central features of OpenVAS Manager are:

* New XML-based protocol OMP (OpenVAS Management Protocol) which client tools
  use to control scans, results, etc.

* SQL database where configurations, scan results etc. are stored. Thus, clients
  do not need to keep local storage anymore.

* Full control of scan processes. This includes multiple concurrent scans as
  well as stopping, pausing, resuming and not at least the scheduling of scans.

* Management of scan notes, false positives and result escalators (notification
  on finished scans).

OpenVAS Manager is Free Software (Open Source), licensed under GNU General
Public License Version 2 or any later version.

The first compatible client application to be released will be the web client
GSA (Greenbone Security Assistant), approximately next week.
Beta- and alpha versions of various clients are already available for download.

The OpenVAS development team offers support for any efforts to create binary
packages for the various Linux distributions in order have this new server
readily available for users as soon as possible. Please use our openvas-distro
mailing list for this purpose.

The OpenVAS Manager aims to be a layer between OpenVAS-Client and
the actual OpenVAS Server. Basically it should be responsible for
any tasks where no high system privileges are required.

This module is in an early development stage and not yet intended for
production use.

It is not mandatory to have OpenVAS Manager for using OpenVAS 1.0 or 2.0.

Usage example:
If openvasd is running on port 7772, the following command starts the manager
on port 1241.  The client can then connect to port 1241 as though it was
connecting to openvasd.

# openvasmd --port 1241 --sport 7772

More information about the command line arguments can be obtained using:

# openvasmd --help
