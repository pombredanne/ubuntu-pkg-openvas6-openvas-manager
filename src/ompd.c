/**
 * @file  ompd.c
 * @brief The OpenVAS Manager OMP daemon.
 *
 * This file defines the OpenVAS Manager daemon.  The Manager serves the OpenVAS
 * Management Protocol (OMP) to clients such as OpenVAS-Client.  The Manager
 * and OMP give clients full access to an OpenVAS Scanner.
 *
 * The library provides two functions: \ref init_ompd and \ref serve_omp.
 * \ref init_ompd initialises the daemon.
 * \ref serve_omp serves OMP to a single client socket until end of file is
 * reached on the socket.
